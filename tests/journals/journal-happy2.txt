Today was a pretty happy day. I was finally able to visit home again for one day! Seeing my cats, my parents, and my brother was definitely a very enjoyable experience. Furthermore, I was able to see Ben and Lukasz, two classmates from school. I think finishing the day off with a nice Amazon Go trip was also very nice.
