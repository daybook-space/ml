Today was a pretty good day. I got my concepts midterm back, and it turns out I got a perfect score! This is a massive relief after I got scared by my performance yesterday. Additionally, I was finally able to do my devotions this morning - something I've been wanting to do for a while. It was definitely good to connect with God personally again.
