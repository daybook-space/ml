dear diary,

today i accidentailly killed someone. i ran them over with my car.

the weird thing is, I didn't feel bad. I didn't know the person, so i didn't really care if they lived or died.

In fact, I think it was fun. There's a strange power to being able to take some random person's life whenever you want. All my life, I have felt powerless to my tormentors, and now, I have found a way to take back control.

anyways, talk to you soon; maybe the next time I write you, my K:D ratio will be higher :)
